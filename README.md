# RGB_filter_app

In this project I would like to present the application built in python, able to filter and display RGB filter for the chosen picture. The graphical interface is written using the Tkinter module, for manipulations with colors and masks the OpenCV module has been applied.

Libraries: Tkinter, PIL, numpy, matplotlib, cv.
